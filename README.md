## Introduction

This is background information to the assignment A4-popular scientific writing, which is one of the assignments required to complete the portfolio. This assignment falls under the heading of the Software Engineering Project, as do the other assignments. In other words, to obtain study credits for the SEP, all portfolio assignments must be completed satisfactorily.

## Objective

The aim is to complete an exercise in writing an English text for a broader, less informed audience (with respect to Computer Science). The most suitable texts shall be used to recruit new first-year students, as well as other PR publications for the program.

## Setup

Using a maximum of 1 A4, the student must give an impression of his/her individual activities within the Software Engineering Project. The writing must therefore be something quite different from a summary for computer scientists. It does not need to be complete, but it must be comprehensible for someone less familiar with computer science. In addition, it should be inspirational. The writing should begin with an overview of the SEP assignment but should then zoom in on one or more individual activities.

## Readability

The piece should not contain terminology that is field related or otherwise, unless clearly explained. Try to incorporate visuals to liven up the text (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 for example). To give you an impression of the required style, an example has been provided. Naturally, your use of English should be correct.

## Format

Readability is facilitated by uniformity. Place the following information above the text: title of the activities, name of the student, name of the program, name of the university, and the date. Use 2 columns as the layout.

## Procedure

After your digital submission (Word or PDF), you will receive feedback. Probably you will be asked to review your writing within a few days. In most cases you will then receive confirmation of having satisfied the componentâ€™s requirements.
